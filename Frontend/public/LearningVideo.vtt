00:01.290 --> 00:04.070
A war has been raging for billions of

00:04.070 --> 00:07.990
years, killing trillions every single day, while we

00:07.990 --> 00:08.890
don't even notice.

00:09.890 --> 00:12.370
The war is fought by the single deadliest

00:12.370 --> 00:16.530
entity on our planet, the bacteriophage, or phage

00:16.530 --> 00:17.070
for short.

00:26.110 --> 00:29.270
A phage is a virus, not quite alive,

00:29.690 --> 00:30.810
not quite dead.

00:31.470 --> 00:33.870
Also, they look as if someone made them

00:33.870 --> 00:34.130
up.

00:34.130 --> 00:37.470
Their head is an icosahedron, a sort of

00:37.470 --> 00:39.910
dice with 20 faces and 30 edges.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.990
It contains the genetic material of the virus

00:42.990 --> 00:45.430
and often sits on a long tail that

00:45.430 --> 00:46.490
has leg-like fibers.

00:47.950 --> 00:50.110
There are more phages on Earth than every

00:50.110 --> 00:52.770
other organism combined, including bacteria.

00:53.870 --> 00:57.070
And they are probably everywhere living things exist.

00:58.310 --> 01:01.030
Billions are on your hands, in your intestines,

01:01.450 --> 01:03.129
and your eyelids right now.

01:03.129 --> 01:06.490
Which might make you nervous, since phages are

01:06.490 --> 01:08.810
responsible for the majority of deaths on Earth.

01:09.450 --> 01:10.550
But you're lucky.

01:11.370 --> 01:14.090
While they do commit genocide for breakfast, they

01:14.090 --> 01:15.490
only kill bacteria.

01:16.170 --> 01:18.630
Up to 40% of all bacteria in

01:18.630 --> 01:20.750
the oceans are killed by them every single

01:20.750 --> 01:21.050
day.

01:22.030 --> 01:24.390
But phages also have major flaws.

01:24.910 --> 01:27.310
Like any other virus, phages need a host

01:27.310 --> 01:28.390
to survive and reproduce.

01:29.230 --> 01:31.790
They're not much more than genetic material in

01:31.790 --> 01:33.530
a hull, and they specialize.

01:34.390 --> 01:37.570
Usually, a phage has chosen one specific bacteria,

01:38.010 --> 01:39.830
and maybe some of its very close relatives.

01:41.090 --> 01:42.170
These are its prey.

01:43.310 --> 01:45.470
Imagine a phage as like a cruise missile

01:45.470 --> 01:47.650
that only hunts and kills members of one

01:47.650 --> 01:48.970
very unlucky family.

01:49.970 --> 01:52.630
When a phage finds its victim, it connects

01:52.630 --> 01:54.890
its tail fibers with receptors and uses a

01:54.890 --> 01:56.610
sort of syringe to puncture the surface.

01:56.610 --> 01:59.810
In a weird motion, the phage squeezes its

01:59.810 --> 02:02.310
tail and injects its genetic information.

02:03.170 --> 02:05.650
Within minutes, the bacteria is taken over.

02:06.330 --> 02:08.789
It's now forced to manufacture all the parts

02:08.789 --> 02:09.669
of new phages.

02:10.490 --> 02:13.070
They only stop when the bacteria is filled

02:13.070 --> 02:14.390
up with brand new phages.

02:14.950 --> 02:18.090
In the final step, they produce endolysin, a

02:18.090 --> 02:20.350
powerful enzyme that punches a hole in the

02:20.350 --> 02:20.750
bacteria.

02:20.750 --> 02:23.990
The pressure is so high that the bacteria

02:23.990 --> 02:26.310
sort of vomits out all of its insides

02:26.310 --> 02:26.950
and dies.

02:28.230 --> 02:31.110
New phages are released and begin the cycle

02:31.110 --> 02:31.510
anew.

02:32.370 --> 02:35.310
In the last few years, bacteriophages have enjoyed

02:35.310 --> 02:37.950
the attention of the second deadliest beings on

02:37.950 --> 02:39.010
Earth, humans.

02:39.990 --> 02:43.190
Recently, we've started looking into injecting millions of

02:43.190 --> 02:44.210
them into our bodies.

02:44.470 --> 02:47.410
Because we're sort of getting desperate, we screwed

02:47.410 --> 02:47.710
up.

02:48.890 --> 02:51.390
In the past, a single cut or a

02:51.390 --> 02:53.170
sip from the wrong puddle could kill you.

02:53.970 --> 02:57.310
Bacteria were our phages, tiny monsters that hunted

02:57.310 --> 02:57.860
us mercilessly.

02:58.870 --> 03:01.430
But then, about 100 years ago, we found

03:01.430 --> 03:02.530
a solution in nature.

03:03.070 --> 03:05.650
By accident, we found fungi that produced a

03:05.650 --> 03:08.230
compound that killed bacteria, antibiotics.

03:09.030 --> 03:10.980
Suddenly, we had a powerful superweapon.

03:13.030 --> 03:15.630
Antibiotics were so effective that we stopped thinking

03:15.630 --> 03:17.030
of bacteria as monsters.

03:17.710 --> 03:19.730
Only the old and weakest among us were

03:19.730 --> 03:20.270
killed by them.

03:21.570 --> 03:24.190
We used antibiotics more and more for less

03:24.190 --> 03:25.370
and less serious causes.

03:26.290 --> 03:29.330
We lost respect for the monsters and the

03:29.330 --> 03:29.630
weapon.

03:30.450 --> 03:33.470
But bacteria are living things that evolve, and

03:33.470 --> 03:35.790
one by one, they started to become immune

03:35.790 --> 03:36.730
against our weapons.

03:37.670 --> 03:40.470
This continued until we had created what are

03:40.470 --> 03:44.590
called superbugs, bacteria immune to almost everything we

03:44.590 --> 03:44.870
have.

03:45.770 --> 03:48.830
This immunity is spreading across the world as

03:48.830 --> 03:49.310
we speak.

03:50.030 --> 03:53.170
By 2050, superbugs could kill more humans a

03:53.170 --> 03:53.930
year than cancer.

03:55.130 --> 03:57.250
The days when a cut or bladder infection

03:57.250 --> 03:58.950
or a cough could kill you or your

03:58.950 --> 04:00.710
loved ones are coming back.

04:01.490 --> 04:04.050
In the US alone, more than 23,000

04:04.050 --> 04:06.650
people die from resistant bacteria each year.

04:07.790 --> 04:11.010
But it turns out that phages, our tiny

04:11.010 --> 04:13.490
killer virus robots, could save us.

04:13.490 --> 04:15.690
We can inject them into our bodies to

04:15.690 --> 04:16.930
help cure infections.

04:18.089 --> 04:21.089
Hold on, how can injecting millions of viruses

04:21.089 --> 04:23.490
into an infection be a good idea?

04:24.570 --> 04:27.630
Phages are very, very specialized killers of bacteria.

04:28.350 --> 04:31.230
So specialized, in fact, that humans are completely

04:31.230 --> 04:31.950
immune to them.

04:32.470 --> 04:33.610
We are too different.

04:34.510 --> 04:37.650
We encounter billions of phages every day and

04:37.650 --> 04:39.630
we just politely ignore each other.

04:40.730 --> 04:44.610
Antibiotics are like carpet bombing, killing everything, even

04:44.610 --> 04:46.730
the good bacteria in our intestines that we

04:46.730 --> 04:47.670
don't want to harm.

04:48.770 --> 04:52.190
Phages are like guided missiles that only attack

04:52.190 --> 04:53.350
what they're supposed to.

04:54.270 --> 04:56.690
Wait a minute, if we use phages to

04:56.690 --> 04:59.930
kill bacteria, won't bacteria develop ways of defending

04:59.930 --> 05:00.410
themselves?

05:01.110 --> 05:03.170
Well, it's more complex than that.

05:03.750 --> 05:04.990
Phages evolve too.

05:04.990 --> 05:08.070
There has been an arms race between them

05:08.070 --> 05:10.610
and bacteria for billions of years and so

05:10.610 --> 05:12.010
far they're doing great.

05:12.810 --> 05:16.350
This makes phages smart weapons that are constantly

05:16.350 --> 05:17.670
getting better at killing.

05:19.370 --> 05:21.850
But even if bacteria were to become immune

05:21.850 --> 05:24.070
against our phage, we still might be able

05:24.070 --> 05:24.450
to win.

05:25.190 --> 05:27.370
It turns out that in order to become

05:27.370 --> 05:29.690
resistant to even just a few species of

05:29.690 --> 05:32.910
phages, bacteria have to give up their resistance

05:32.910 --> 05:33.970
to antibiotics.

05:34.990 --> 05:37.130
We might be able to trap them in

05:37.130 --> 05:37.930
a catch-22.

05:39.390 --> 05:42.890
This has already been successfully tested with a

05:42.890 --> 05:44.890
patient who had no other hope left.

05:45.870 --> 05:48.750
The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most

05:48.750 --> 05:51.730
feared bacteria, infected the man's chest cavity.

05:53.370 --> 05:56.850
They are naturally resistant to most antibiotics and

05:56.850 --> 05:59.150
can even survive in alcoholic hand gel.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.690
After years of suffering, a few thousand phages

06:02.690 --> 06:05.810
were directly inserted into his chest cavity together

06:05.810 --> 06:08.270
with antibiotics the bacteria were immune to.

06:09.010 --> 06:11.990
After a few weeks, the infections had completely

06:11.990 --> 06:12.630
disappeared.

06:13.530 --> 06:17.070
Unfortunately, this treatment is still experimental and pharma

06:17.070 --> 06:19.710
companies are still reluctant to invest the necessary

06:19.710 --> 06:22.270
billions in a treatment that has no official

06:22.270 --> 06:23.010
approval yet.

06:23.730 --> 06:26.130
But things are finally changing.

06:26.130 --> 06:29.730
In 2016, the largest phage clinical trial to

06:29.730 --> 06:32.370
date began and phages are getting more and

06:32.370 --> 06:32.910
more attention.

06:34.010 --> 06:36.010
And we better get used to it because

06:36.010 --> 06:38.450
the era in which antibiotics have been our

06:38.450 --> 06:40.910
super weapon is drawing to a close.

06:41.930 --> 06:45.350
It might be a weird concept, but injecting

06:45.350 --> 06:48.450
the deadliest being on planet Earth directly into

06:48.450 --> 06:51.450
our bodies could save millions of lives.

06:53.090 --> 06:55.290
This video was made possible by a grant

06:55.290 --> 06:56.870
from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

06:57.410 --> 06:59.330
If you'd like to support Kurzgesagt, you can

06:59.330 --> 07:02.630
do so on patreon.com and get fancy

07:02.630 --> 07:03.490
things in return.
