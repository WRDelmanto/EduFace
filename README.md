## About
Emotion-Triggered Micro-Adaptation: A Real-Time Feedback System for Personalized Digital Learning

Research Questions:
1. Which learner emotions can be reliable detected in real time using facial expressions during learning sessions?
2. How can real-time emotion detection be used to trigger adaptive micro-interventions (e.g., pauses, hints, content speed changes) during content delivery?
3. To what extent does real-time emotion-aware improve learner engagement and immediate content comprehension compared to non-adaptive systems?

Research Objectives:
1. To assess the real-time detection accuracy of learner emotions based on facial expressions during digital learning.
2. To design and implement adaptive micro-inventions (e.g., pauses, content slowing, hints) based on real-time emotional cues.
3. To evaluate the impact on emotion-triggered real-time adaptations on learner engagement and short-term comprehension.

## Initial Setup (Windows)
