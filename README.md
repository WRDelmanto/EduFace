## About
This project explores the use of AI to monitor learners' facial expressions during study sessions. The primary goal is to investigate whether emotion recognition can help identify key emotional states—such as confusion, frustration, or engagement—in real time, providing insights that could enhance personalized learning and support.

## Initial Setup (Windows)

To start developing this wonderful idea with us, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download and install
- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Clone the existing repository

### Setting up Virtual Environment for Backend (Windows)

3. Open Command Prompt (cmd) as administrator
4. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd path\to\EDUFACE
   ```
5. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   py -3.12 -m venv venv
   ```
6. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
7. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):
   ```
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python src\main.py
   ```

## Deactivating Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
```
deactivate
```
